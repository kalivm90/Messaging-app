Styles for nav-links in MD-XL screens are scattered. the active bg-color is seperated from the sign out bg-color so if you want to change 1 you have to change all.

consolidate all of the themes under some classes so they are neatly grouped and easier to maintain.

also make sure to include the sm screens as well.
